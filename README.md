# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @knappast
I have been coding for a long long time. Started in highschool with Basic and after that Pascal, Lisp, Scheme, VBA, 
a lot of C, massive coding in Smalltalk and even more in Java, somewhat in C++, shellscript, javascript, typescript.
Not so much in Erlang, Prolog, C#, Cobol, Assembler, Php, Python, Fortran.

I've done more gui-oriented solutions that I can keep track of. Done server/client stuff since day one (almost) Interfaced to different sorts of db:s. 
Even object db:s such as Gemstone and Versant (dbs that where way ahead techwise). And of cource Mysql, MS SQL Server, Oracle and MongoDB and even MS Acccess,
and a little less with Neo4J.

AND a lot of other cool and not so cool stuff :-)

AND I have a wife and two grown up kids meaing I'm not totally socially akward :-)
