# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @knappast
I have been coding for a long long time. Started in highschool with Basic and after that Pascal, Lisp, Scheme, VBA, 
a lot of C, massive coding in Smalltalk and even more in Java, somewhat in C++, Shellscript, Javascript, Typescript.
Not so much in Erlang, Prolog, C#, Cobol, Assembler, Php, Python, Fortran.

I've done more gui-oriented solutions that I can keep track of. Done server/client stuff since day one (almost). Some realtime stuff. Interfaced to different sorts of db:s. 
Now mostely MongoDB, and of course Mysql, MS SQL Server, Oracle and even MS Acccess, and a little less with Neo4J. Even object db:s such as Gemstone and Versant.
DBs that where way ahead techwise.

Now even "new" stuff such as Angualar with Typescript. Not so much with Reactive or Vue. Even though to be honest I really don't understand that much why and how the inner parts of how the web/browser-stuff works :-). But
it's fun.

AND a lot of other cool and not so cool stuff :-)

But this is not what I work with. I am a business architect with main focus on helping organisations to get control over their (intellectual) information assets.

AND I have a wife and two grown up kids meaing I'm not totally socially akward :-)
